# Notes

## Background

### Statics

Statics is analysis of force and torque moments acting on a system

First work by

- Archimedes
- Thebit

F=ma
M=_I_\alpha

summation of moments M = 0 in equilibrium
I moment of inertia

first condition for equilibrium is net force 0 and second condition is net torque 0

sum of all forces in all 3 directions =0 for equilibrium

COG is important for engineering

solid mechanics studies deformations of solids under changes of :

- forces
- temperature
- phase changes
- other external/internal changes

deformation is delta between rest shape and current shape

models to describe deformations:

- elasticity
- viscoelasticity
- plasticity
- thermoelasticity

uniaxial stress equations
